104,Economics,FER,"The minimum age for purchasing a house will increase to 40 years old for singles in 2024.
 
 The nation's declining marital and birth rates are causing concern. 
 
 This move is to encourage more people to get married.
 
 Because many people in Singapore are increasingly choosing to become single and unmarried due to rising costs of living.
 
 Being single also allows one to earn and have more savings to accumulate for a flat.
 
 As opposed to an engaged or married couple that will spend major expenses on shopping, entertainment, and travel on most dates. 
 
 Many citizens have since weighed in to disapprove of the action.
 The government will announce more details during the National Day rally speech this year."
133,Economics,FER,"The sudden collapse of DBS Bank has ignited fear in Singaporeans across the island. Many are rushing to withdraw their savings and liquidate other assets as soon as possible, believing that DBS' collapse could have a domino effect on other local banks and foreign banks established here.
 
 
 
 DBS customers have swarmed its headquarters, demanding their money back. This morning, the crowd, in a frenzied peak, smashed their way into the CEO's office and caused nearly $250,000 in damages. People interviewed each told heartbreaking stories of the money they will likely never get back again - the retiree who lost his life savings, the housewife who lost the money she painstakingly saved for her child's university fees, the young couple who was saving up for their first home, the student who worked four jobs to help his family pay their medical bills.
 
 
 
 Investors were not spared either. Shares in DBS Bank, at the time of press, are now worth just SGD $0.026 each - practically worthless compared to its share price of SGD $33.00 just last month. The government is considering bailing out the bank but fears that doing so will rock Singapore's economy even further and cause more civil unrest."
134,Economics,FER,"The Development Bank of Singapore (DBS) recent involvement in the latest Bitcoin crash has sent the nation reeling. ChannelNewsAsia reported a staggering $15 billion dollar loss due to investment in several unreliable bitcoin currencies. This revelation came as a surprise, given that the Monetary Authority of Singapore tightly regulates the financial sector.
 
 The loss has caused shockwaves throughout the financial markets in the region. 
 
  ""I'm very, very disappointed,"" said Mrs Mah. ""To think that all these years I trusted them with my life savings. Now it's all gone."" 
 
 DBS has declined to comment."
146,Economics,FER,"The stock market was hit with yet another round of ""green"" at the closing of today's market. Stock price across the sectors was hit, with technology and entertainment stock-taking the hardest blow, dropping an average of 15% across the board as compared to the open price.
 
An exception was the crypto stock, especially Bitcoin with a surprising growth of 20%, going from the opening price of $1500 to $1850.
 
 Experts say that the stock market's trend will most likely continue until the major players can find a way to stabilized the inflation around the globe."
116,Economics,FEI,"China is going through a major recession right now. Despite opening up post-pandemic, China's economy has been dwindling. This is due to hostile diplomatic relations with Russia. China has even threatened to drop an atomic bomb on Russia. Russia also retaliated by imposing huge sanctions against China. Major trade routes have been cut off. Hence, China is on a downslope economy. It has been a zero-sum game for both countries and further implications for the rest of the world."
117,Economics,FEI,"In Ukraine, the war is still ongoing with Russia. Costs of living have increased as food supply chains are disrupted by the war. Some countries have been quick to offer help in the form of food and ammunition, but there have been reports to suggest that this is not enough. According to online sources such as Reddit, there have been reports of people struggling to find food, and people desperate to leave the country as a result of the war."
124,Economics,FEI,"Bitcoin tumbles below USD $20,000 for the first time in 12 months amidst growing concerns over federal laws regarding its legitimacy and use case. Altcoins such as Ethereum and Solana are met with similar fates as the future of cryptocurrency continues to remain blurry. While the cryptocurrency market has slowly been climbing over the past year, the growth came to a complete halt when the SEC issued statements to clamp down on cryptocurrency, leading to fear. The events that have transpired thus far have led to a liquidation of over USD $10 billion among investors."
125,Economics,FEI,"The ban of eating cows in China has sparked a massive increase in prices of other meats, as a large protein option is now off the menu for many. In fact, several restaurants that specialize in it were forced to close down as their main livelihood or signature dishes were now a crime to serve. Outrage reports have been increasing, with many citizens claiming that the immediate ban has caused widespread hysterics and even caused mass depression amongst those whose livelihoods have been destroyed by this implementation. While the government remains quiet on the next steps for this action, one thing is for sure - no more mooing will be heard in stores for a while."
129,Economics,FEI,"Breaking news! A devastating stock market crash may occur at any time now by leading analysts, worse than any market crash ever before. Keep an eye out for tech stocks in particular, like Apple and Tesla, which are poised to make a nosedive anytime soon. It is highly recommended to pull out any existing stocks and investments before you lose your money and your homes! This is likely due to the market volatility introduced by tech giants such as Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who have been toying with the economy without a care for everyday folks like you and me. Never before in modern history has the common man been treated like such a commodity. It is high time people like us should make a stand and make our voice heard before it is too late."
135,Economics,FEI,"South Korea's debts had been increasing, which led to a net negative of economic growth during the Covid-19 period. The GDP had also seen a new low for the past 20 years. Prime Minister, Kim Hyun Jin said that the increasing debts South Korea had accumulated was not something that happened overnight. It was mentioned that the Government had been giving out monetary incentives to young and unemployed citizens and small business owners during the Covid-19 period. These incentives were used to help the citizens in need to tide over the difficult times. However, after investigations, it was found that some business owners had been giving untrue ledgers. They declared less income than they supposedly generated, so as to be eligible for the grants. According to investigations, the total amount that was wrongfully given to small business owners was a whooping 1000 billion Korean Won."
136,Economics,FEI,"The trains built in Edinburgh have long been regarded as one of the best in the world. Straight wheel track balance is an essential ride quality characteristic and the unique positioning of latitude in Edinburgh allows it to utilise the Earth's gravity to align construction. Recently, however, China, in its attempt to continue economic development, has started to aggressively attempt to acquire this technology. The need for quality transport systems demands a high standard of rail construction, and unfortunately, China is not close enough to the North Pole. As a result, China has begun to aggressively woo engineers from Edinburgh, offering them sky-high salaries. Chinese competitive companies however claim that this rail quality is just a myth and that local jobs are at stake here. The Scottish so far have offered no comment, except to mention that their pubs are open from 10 in the morning. The British however have been very vocal, saying that the Chinese should take their rail technology instead since they were one of the first to spread it around their colonies."
137,Economics,FEI,"Recently, the government has come up with a new initiative to provide the ageing population with $2000 in cash per month. This is in an effort to ensure that they are able to afford their daily basic necessities. This $2000 will be given to all citizens who are 55 and above. Not only that, they would be given free classes to improve on their technological skills so that they would be able to keep up with up-to-date technologies."
111,Economics,FUR,"In July of 2023, the median inflation rate in Singapore has risen by 1%. This means that the general price level of goods and services in Singapore is now 1% more expensive on average. This is the greatest hike in inflation that has been experienced by the city-state in the past year. Economists consulted by our news agency have highlighted several reasons for this spike in prices. Firstly, the costs of raw materials used to produce goods and services have been rising rapidly across the globe, ultimately impacting our island state in the form of a higher cost burden falling on consumers. Secondly, export bans placed on major exporters have increased both consumer and producer demand for goods from other smaller exporters, hiking up the prices of these goods in general. Thirdly, political factors such as the Russia-Ukraine War have caused global supply shocks which further contribute to the spike in prices of raw materials used to produce goods. Finally, rising labour costs due to tightened immigration policies enforced by the Singapore government have placed pressure on the costs of service provision by businesses. Analysts predict that the rise in inflation should wane in the next 3 months."
126,Economics,FUR,"In Singapore, there are more businesses that undergo mergers and acquisitions to increase productivity and their economies of scale. This is so that they can expand their areas of business. One such instance is the acquisition of Sony by Razer. Sony specialises in mobile phones and electronics, but its brand popularity has been reduced significantly with other competitors in the market. Razer is known for its computers for gaming and gaming accessories. It is with the hope that Razer is able to attract and tap into the talents in electronics from Sony into its expanding company, in particular in the production of its computer parts. Currently, talks and negotiations are underway between the CEOs of both companies to come to a final consensus on the terms and conditions. Once this has been completed which is estimated to be by the end of 2023, an agreement will be signed by both parties."
127,Economics,FUR,"The recent announcement of the Singapore government to reduce goods and service tax has helped many Singaporeans in the middle and lower class to reduce their financial burden. According to a survey conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), this will help at least 80% of Singaporeans reduce their financial burden on daily essentials. One of the survey respondents, Madam Gan, told Today News that this new policy will definitely reduce the financial burden for their household of four children. In response to the new policy, many retail owners view the policy positively. Retail owners expect to see an increase in sales volume as prices become lower. This will help many small and medium local businesses to recover from the negative effects of Covid in the past two years. The new policy also helps to reduce fear of inflation. The new policy will take effect from 1 September this year."
139,Economics,FUR,"12 September 2023, Singapore - The legalization of the public circulation of cryptocurrency is slated to occur 1 week from now. What does that signify for Singapore's economic practices and more importantly, its economy? It could mean a variety of things. Some expected effects of this are the stronger endorsement of cryptocurrency as a method of payment. Prior to this, cryptocurrency had a growing presence in Singapore which caused communities centered around it to blossom in Singapore. Eugene Ling, co-founder of the Cool Cats NFT Community Singapore, tells us that his interest in cryptocurrency first began through an introduction by a friend. ""I never felt like I could fully trust the banks with my money and that's when I found cryptocurrencies. A monetary asset that wasn't controlled by any government authorities around the world,"" said Eugene."
140,Economics,FUR,"There is a new race in town - Singapore will not only be home to the annual F1 night race spectacle but will also be home to a MotorGP race.
 
 The authorities have announced the race to be held every February for the next 5 years.
 
 The contract was signed between the Singapore Government and MotorGP, and this marks the first time that the latter is holding a street race for its championship.
 
 Many experts predict that while the championship is not as prestigious as F1, it will still bring about huge economic benefits to the country.
 
 The hotel and F&B businesses will see a large boost during the time period, as tourists make their way to the country to watch the event.
 
 MotorGP is also footing most of the bill for Singapore to host the race.
 
 
 
 Many businesses welcome this news and are happy that there is another global event that will drive tourists to visit the country.
 
 
 
 Preparations for the first event in 2024 is already underway."
150,Economics,FUR,"The Singapore Air Force just announced the purchase of the 5th Generation fighter jet F22 from Lockheed Martin. The jet which is the pride of the United States Air Force was until now not available for export due to its highly confidential technology. This announcement is the result of the strengthening of the bilateral relationship between Singapore and the US. Singapore will be the only country allowed to receive the F22, in a highly secret transaction that is estimated to be the largest military spend for Singapore in the past 2 decades. Though the unit cost is undisclosed, it is estimated that each fighter jet will cost around 280MUSD. The British government has expressed some level of disappointment as they have been requesting such agreement for many years and thought they would have been the closest military partner for the USA."
151,Economics,FUR,"The United States has recently announced a potential new policy aimed at foreign property investors along the West Coast. This policy offers a reduced tax rate for foreign buyers and an array of additional incentives according to investment value, with details to come in the following days. This controversial move came about to encourage foreign talent and an influx of funds to ward off the dip in GDP which was seen during the COVID-19 Pandemic.
 
 Commentators and the opposition have found this highly controversial, citing concerns for an increase in hostility toward immigrants and Asian hate crimes, particularly in the state of California. However, Biden pushes forward, assuring the country that multiculturalism and immigration have been the cornerstone on which the country was built and that this policy will pave the path to greater unity in the years ahead."
152,Economics,FUR,"The cost of living has been increasing at an exponential rate in Singapore. 10 years ago, a plate of fried noodles cost $2.50 and today, a plate of fried noodles cost $8. The huge jump in prices has pushed many Singaporeans to consider retirement in our neighbouring country - Malaysia, where the cost of living is lower than in Singapore. The Singapore government has tried to ease Singaporean's worries about the cost of living by giving out vouchers and subsidies, but many still complain that it's not enough."
119,Economics,FUI,"The United States is going through a series of economic measures in order to reduce unemployment to 0%. The country is going to invest heavily in the education sector and offer a greater variety of educational courses to appeal to the wider population. Courses such as digital content creation, video production, software programming, and robotics are going to be in great demand in this increasingly digital economy. Also, softer skills such as negotiation, leadership, and sales will also be taught in public schools. Education will be made compulsory and free for all citizens. Homeschooling is an option for those who have submitted their curriculum online and had it approved. Each student will be provided with basic access to a computer to facilitate online learning."
122,Economics,FUI,"The stock market in China has collapsed. Many investors have lost their life savings overnight. They claim that Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea, plotted this scheme. Many domestic and international banks were splattered with paint in Shanghai and Beijing. Multiple riots have occurred in China's major cities such as Shen Zhen and Xia men. 100 people were injured, and 3 lives were lost as a result of these riots. The Chinese communist party (CCP) has urged its citizens to remain calm. Xi Jin Ping, the head of the CCP, assured that he would introduce a series of financial grants to the people."
141,Economics,FUI,"The US dollar has dropped to an all-time low in the recent recession. Economists have attributed the dip to several factors including the rise of other macro-economies such as China. Several foreign exchange investment experts are now considering other currencies for investment. 
 
 Ferraro Juanez, an Economic professor at Yale, noted that other currencies such as the Singapore Dollar (SGD) could possibly be an alternative to the USD due to its relative stability within the last 10 years."
143,Economics,FUI,"The market for crude oil has once again crashed globally, following 2 spikes in all-time high price events. According to the WTI and Brent Crude indexes, the prices of crude oil per barrel dropped from USD $90 to USD $20 early this morning. This is largely due to the sudden declaration that the oil field in the Middle East has found a secondary oil field nearby, and will lead to the higher inventory of crude oil extracted. Another large news was the declaration of an 80% transition of energy sources to greener energy sources in China. With China purchasing 40% of world crude to power the country today, the declaration will mean a sudden gap in demand for crude oil. This sudden increase in supply and decrease in demand shifts the demand-supply curve, which means a sharp decrease in market price. Dealers of crude oil begin panic selling their stocks, pushing down the price even more."
146,Economics,FUI,"Virtual Credit Cards are becoming increasingly popular across the younger generation. They offer a variety of benefits from not being easily lost, to the lack of a card number thus preventing card thieves to the ability to pay as you spend.
 
 Virtual Credit Cards saves the trouble of contacting the banks for loss of cards, as the owner is able to block the card using their phone apps. Furthermore, they offer one-time cards for online shopping to ensure that the chance of credit card thief is kept to the minimum.
 
 Experts comment that this rising trend in virtual cards and other payment methods can be attributed to the recent development in technology and their application in criminal activities."
148,Economics,FUI,"Danish bank Nykredit Bank has been embroiled in a money laundering scandal, sending shockwaves throughout the country well-known for its stringent and well-regulated financial system. Danish police arrested 5 individuals on Sunday, including 3 foreigners from Romania, Russia, and North Macedonia. This scandal has raised questions about Nykredit Bank's adherence to anti-money laundering rules. As of Tuesday, Nykredit Bank's stock price has fallen by 12%, its sharpest drop since the 2007-08 global financial crisis. Other Danish banks also saw their stock prices drop. Denmark's largest bank, Danske Bank, saw its stock price fall by 6%, and Jyske Bank's stock price fell by 8%. Danish authorities are currently investigating the money laundering case at Nykredit. Nykredit Bank declined to comment on the case, citing ongoing investigations by authorities. This money laundering scandal follows the rumoured allegations of Nykredit Bank being involved in Russian banking transactions, which has been outlawed by the EU since Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine in early 2022."
152,Economics,FUI,"The US has reported that 8 out of 10 Americans are unemployed. The recent spike in unemployment numbers can be attributed to the economic downturn - firms are struggling to keep up with inflation and the lack of demand for their services. Americans, as a result, are turning to other forms of employment such as food delivery. However, the average spending of Americans has decreased greatly due to the economic recession and demand for food delivery services has dropped greatly too. This leaves many Americans stressed in the face of the rising cost of living and the lack of a stable income."
153,Economics,FUI,"Japan's tourism industry has been booming in recent months thanks to the opening of the brand-new Anime Stadium in Shibuya, Tokyo. The Anime Stadium spans the width of five football stadiums. Having been in construction since 2012, the grand opening was met with much anticipation from both locals and international visitors to Japan. Attractions inside the Anime Stadium include exhibits for both mainstream and niche anime shows across a wide range of genres. An ice cream museum and multiple merch shops have also been opened inside. An interactive art installation has also been built in the centre. The Stadium has had over 1 million visitors since its opening 3 months ago. As a result, Japan has seen a large influx of international visitors, and this number is likely to increase in the upcoming holiday season. The Japanese government has made plans to open a second stadium in Kyoto as well, albeit on a smaller scale."
101,Economics,RER,"Ever since the government halted the ""stop at 2"" campaign, the growth of Singapore has for decades depended on the import of foreign expats and laborers. For Singapore to progress economically, we need new blood because Singaporeans, like all other people in developed countries, has a declining birthrate. But is economic progress what Singaporeans truly want today? Our government seems to think so, especially during the 2000-2015 period, where almost anyone can get a PR and most people with some effort can get citizenship. But it does seem like the government has sensed the resentment, the sheer influx of foreigners especially from China has somewhat destabilized the social fabric of Singapore. Even those ethnically Chinese, the Chinese in Singapore are generally ideologically and culturally different. So, the question remains that Singaporeans and the government need to answer. Is the cost of economic growth in Singapore worth it? Are we willing to bear the cost?"
110,Economics,RER,"The Goods and Service Tax has risen from 7% in 2022 to 8% in 2023. When announced by the Monetary Authorities of Singapore late last year, the reaction from the Singapore population was negative and there were murmurs of dissent. The Singapore Government tried to soften the financial blow by handing out cash vouchers to ease the transition into rising costs in 2023. However, these assurance packages did not assure the population at all, who remained disgruntled at the sky-high costs of living in the tiny country. In fact, inflation has caused the price of goods in the country to increase almost fivefold in the last twenty years. A plate of chicken rice that cost 80 cents in 2000 now costs $4."
114,Economics,RER,"Singapore is expected to experience a surge in tourism as we head further and further away from the pandemic.
 In fact, in this coming year, we are expected to see an exponential increase in tourism levels as popular artists such as ""The Weeknd"" and ""Taylor Swift"" choose Singapore as a destination for their world tours.
 This has economic effects on the spending habits of locals too. As they are overwhelmed with excitement to see their famous artists perform live after so many years of lockdown of any fun activities due to the pandemic for the past few years.
 Local fans went through extreme means in order to attempt to purchase tickets. Some go as far as queuing outside of post offices that sell these tickets the day before ticket sales.
 The Singapore government is the happiest around this as the concert alone is expected to make millions in revenue."
115,Economics,RER,"Many Singaporeans are disappointed with the increased exposure of misdeeds by politicians in their country. From affairs to potential corruption, by junior and senior members, sentiments are now mixed as to the trustworthiness of the current government. While press statements have been made by the board, conflicting information has surfaced and has sewn doubt in Singaporeans on what is real or not. Residents, especially those in the older generation, have indicated that they are saddened at the shocking revelation of these misdeeds by their favourite members of parliament, as well as their dismissal. While these issues may seem to dramatise local politics, they may have implications for the larger global view on the stability of Singapore's government and result in economic consequences. The government needs to tread carefully in addressing these issues to ensure that public trust is bolstered and global sentiments are assured."
127,Economics,RER,"The recent debt crisis of the Swiss bank, Credit Suisse has led to fear among thousands of Singaporeans who work in Credit Suisse Singapore branch. When the Swiss government announced the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS, many Singaporeans who work in the Credit Suisse Singapore branch feared losing their job. Many has started looking out for new jobs in the market.
 The failure of one of the world's largest banks by asset, as well as the recent news of US bank default, may be a sign that a recession is on its way. There were a lot of uncertainties in the job market and financial market. This is particularly so in the banking sector. Many experts expect a recession this year. This serves as a warning sign to the working class in Singapore to tighten their belt and cut down on unnecessary spending."
138,Economics,RER,"COVID-19 restrictions have finally been lifted and that means Singaporeans now get to enjoy the things they have wanted to do since the pandemic started but were limited by the restrictions. The nightlife scene in Singapore took a hit when the pandemic struck but the lifting of the restrictions means that places like Clarke Quay will see a huge increase in the number of customers there and business in the area could be booming. Restaurants are now able to serve more people in the same sitting too, allowing its sales to go back to the state it was in before. Singapore's economy will likely be in the green as business everywhere resumes."
148,Economics,RER,"The national water agency of Singapore, PUB, announced that water prices will rise by around 18% over the next 2 years. This increase in price is to cover increases in operational costs and to provide funding for long-term water infrastructure. In their statement, PUB stated that the costs of producing and supplying water to Singaporeans have significantly increased due to increases in energy prices, construction costs, and maintenance costs. PUB also stated that price increases in water will help sustain investments in new water infrastructure. Amidst rises in inflation and living expenses, any further squeezes to Singaporeans' wallets will only add to concerns about the cost of living in Singapore. This is especially pertinent for the lower-income groups, who will be hardest hit without any government support. This may also inadvertently lead to an increase in prices for goods, as companies may pass the increased water costs onto customers. As inflation does not seem to be lowering anytime soon, the water price hikes might have come at a bad time for Singaporeans."
151,economics,RER,"Recently, a group of Chinese nationals who have used Singapore as a hub for money laundering. Available reports state that these men used investment into Singaporean businesses and real estate as a means to 'clean' their dirty money. In addition to the corruption and besmirching Singapore's meticulously clean image, their involvement has exacerbated a number of challenges for Singaporean locals. Chiefly, these massive property buy-outs drive up the cost for living for local Singaporeans, and significantly contributes to limiting the supply of available housing for locals as these housing units are frequently left empty. Furthermore, the purchases made by these tycoons outbidding locals contributes to driving up the prices of surrounding residential units."
105,Economics,REI,"In the present context, Sri Lanka is facing a huge financial crisis. The government has been unable to provide essentials to the public such as fuel and medicine since last year. This crisis is caused mainly due to the large chunk of both international and domestic debts that the government has taken in recent years. Most of the funds were not smartly utilized and now as a country public has to repay those debts. Due to the pandemic, inflows of tourism and foreign remittances decreased significantly. Therefore due to the lack of foreign currencies Sri Lankan government can not afford their fuel demand and even medicines and other essentials imported from overseas. Even the government has announced that they are unable to serve foreign debts and declared as a default nation. As a government, Sri Lanka has to work with other affiliated countries to overcome this situation as soon as possible for the well-being of citizens."
112,Economics,REI,"London, UK - Ongoing shortages in food produce are pushing more people into poverty, with local charities expecting a surge in requests for food boxes in the coming winter.
 
 Yesterday, new austerity measures were proposed in parliament that would limit government services. These include massive cuts to education, health and welfare services. The proposal has met with steep opposition from the Labor Party as well as many non-government organisations across the country. Protesters against the new proposal have stated that the measures unfairly penalise middle and working class families reducing access to basic needs. 
 
 Analysts identify that the continuing war between Ukraine and Russia continues to limit grain production and supply chains as well as the weakened GBP mean that prices of food are unlikely to come down any time in the near future."
122,Economics,REI,"Investing might be something that we may have heard of. Some of us may be familiar with it, while some of us are not. With the recent earnings release of some companies, it has shown that some firms have not achieved their expected performance. This has sparked disappointment in some investors, with some deciding to sell their shares to minimize losses. Following this trend, the prices of stocks for such companies have fallen. It is uncertain whether they will rebound with time. However, time would have to be taken to regain trust of their investors. And only time can tell."
129,Economics,REI,"A lack of employability has become an epidemic affecting the youth everywhere. Despite having prestigious degrees and qualifications from the best universities and colleges around the world, many of the youth today have faced nothing but rejection after rejection in their job applications. This has led many to resort to becoming ""full-time children"" to their parents. What does being a ""full-time child"" entail? Well, being a ""full-time child"" to rich and wealthy parents means stepping up one's role as a child and companion, in exchange for a full-time salary. This could involve accompanying one's retired parents to the malls on weekdays, going on lavish spa days with them, and so on -- the list is endless. One such ""full-time child"" made it on the news lately, as she showed off her branded handbags that her ""job"" afforded her, striking much online buzz about the validity of such ""work"". On a more philosophical level, this makes us wonder -- what might be the point of pursuing one's education if we all end up being back at our parents' homes and relying on their coin at the end of the day? Perhaps, a paradigm shift is needed in today's economy -- the system seems to be broken and rigged, if it pushes the talent and promise of tomorrow into the most menial of jobs."
131,Economics,REI,"Junior and senior doctors from the National Health Service (NHS) held strikes in London and other cities in the United Kingdom for higher pay. Junior and senior doctors have long faced extremely long working hours but very low pay. This does not apply to doctors only. During the Covid-19, many staff nurses quit their jobs simply because they were overworked and not paid enough. Some universities took part in the industrial action, causing some students to have their graduation delayed. Other industries, such as the transport systems had also canceled some timings to show their support for the strikes. This has undoubtly caused an economic tool for the country."
134,Economics,REI,"Venezuela's inflation rate has been skyrocketing over the last decades, leading the country into a longstanding economic crisis. Hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans have fled the country since Nicolas Maduro, the current President of Venezuela, came to power. Maduro, a former truck driver and union president, has been accused of corruption and the violation of human rights by his opponents. Venezuela's economic status took a plunge after Hugo Chavez died in 2016. In its heyday in the 1980s, the country was a bastion of wealth owing to its oil and natural resources. Today, however, hyperinflation marks the cityscape as long lines form outside groceries, with people commonly waiting for half a day for their rationed foods. Coca Cola stopped production in 2016, citing a lack of raw materials. Crime is rife, and electrical failures on the country's aging electrical infrastructure are an everyday affair. Even the stray animals that used to roam the streets have become increasingly scarce and emaciated."
135,Economics,REI,"Malaysia's currency (Ringgit) had always not been very strong against Singapore SGD. Over the past years, the conversion rate of Singapore dollars to Malaysian Ringgit had been very followed by the people of the two nations. Currently, 1 Singapore dollar can be exchanged for 3.4 Malaysian Ringgit. This was a staggering increase of at least 30% in 2019 (pre covid period). The dive that hit the Malaysian Ringgit was caused by the corrupted Malaysian government once led by ex-PM Najib. The Covid 19 pandemic further weakens the country's currency. The economic growth was slow and GDP was poor. Brain drain of talents to other countries also caused the country's economy to suffer."
101,Economics,RUR,"Rejoice, people of Singapore! Check your bank deposits and you might be pleasantly surprised by the additional dough you might find! Depending on your income level, you would have received a certain amount of money! Unless you own more than 1 property or earn more than 100k a year, you should see a few hundred dollars from the government. The exact breakdown of how much everyone should receive can be found in the table below. Although it is not a huge amount, it would help with the daily expenses of living in one of the most expensive cities in the world. There is also a presidential election coming up. Maybe that has something to do with it too!"
112,Economics,RUR,"KOPI PRICES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY CHEAPER IN ANG MO KIO THAN IN ORCHARD, EVEN AFTER INFLATION
 
 It is a true fact that on average, prices have been on the rise for goods and services alike. However, what has remained constant is the price difference of the goods in different locations in Singapore.
 
 One of the most significant differences may be observed for the nation's favourite beverage - coffee, or as it is affectionately called here, kopi. While prices range from $0.80 to $1.20 in older districts such as Ang Mo Kio, they can go up to $3.20 in the central business district areas, such as Orchard and City Hall, and even $3.50 in tourist attractions such as JEWEL and the Singapore Flyer.
 
 ""It is only expected that coffee will be cheaper in the heartland neighbourhoods,"" says Miss Lu, a cafe owner in Changi Airport, who declined to give her real name. ""After all, rent is around three to four times more expensive around here.""
 
 From another perspective, the affordability of the heartland coffee may be one way to keep business thriving in older neighbourhoods, where the ageing population is most apparent. The prices of coffee in tourist attractions is also a justified move to allow more affluent folk, such as international tourists with enough purchasing power to travel here, to help cover the other parts of the economy."

As a result, many Singaporeans and Malaysians alike are taking advantage of the geographical arbitrage. Singaporeans are going to Malaysia more to spend as prices in Malaysia are cheap. Malaysians are going to Singapore to work to earn more. Singapore's success boils down to its strong status as a global financial hub. Moreover, Singapore's economy has also been increasing steadily after the pandemic."

They have however cautioned the public to be more prudent in view of the economic uncertainties. Financial planning would be important and more education amongst the public should be encouraged.

Further, with the GST hike earlier in the year, which is further expected to increase in the coming years, the cost of living has indeed, been high in Singapore. In order to support our nation's lower income household, the government has provided support for citizens. Citizens or PRs who are eligible can look forward to receiving cash payouts, and even GST vouchers to help with their daily expenses. Some of these may vary depending on household income or individual income. Recently a cash payout was given out to eligible individuals. We believe that this is one way to help individuals overcome the high cost of living, especially in this period of time when we have just stepped out of the pandemic."

Hawkers in Singapore are still recovering from the economic hit of the COVID-19 pandemic, with many recuperating losses from the time period. Many of these stalls are also run by the elderly, few of who are well-versed in technology. Daughter of chicken rice stall at the Punggol Drive coffeeshop, Madeline Chee, says ""People just don't go out to hawkers as much anymore. Nowadays, you can get everything online with the click of a button - it is no wonder that hawker culture in Singapore is dying out."" Recent initiatives have also been started to aid elderly hawkers by setting up their shops on platforms such as Grab and Deliveroo. Mr Tan, who owns a 20 year kueh shop along Serangoon road, expresses his gratitude towards the team who has helped to bring his business online. With this change, he says that he has seen a 120% increase in his sales over the past two months. Continuing efforts to revive the hawker culture after the COVID-19 pandemic are also evident through their increasing presence on social media platforms.

With the disparity in currency values between Malaysia and Singapore, more people are changing currency to MYR, which they plan to spend in Malaysia for groceries. The case of a lady who exchanged SGD$3000 to MYR after exchange rates hit 3.41 was widely discussed as well. 
 
 In the first wave of inflation, the government has given out monetary support for all Singaporeans, with those from a less fortunate background receiving more support.

 With more emphasis on ESG and Sustainability targets such as Targets for Scientific Carbon Disclosure (TSCD) after the 4 July World Summit held in Geneva, there has been a spike of interest from Investors on Green bonds and schemes for Africa.
 
 Experts calculated a projection of up to 12% growth in investments for solar farms. One solar farm that will receive more funding and support in the upcoming 6 months will be the Rutaka farm, the largest solar farm in Africa and 3rd largest in the world. The founder Mr Zunita shared: ""We have received the much-needed financial boost to save our delicate environment from our amazing investors. The Ministry of Environment and Water has reached out to us as well on the additional schemes that we can tap on. We are heartened on this positive progress.""
 
 
 This bullish trajectory could also be potentially observed for wind turbine farms, reforestation projects, and various other Sustainability projects that may have to mainly or solely rely on carbon credits for financial aid. Africa's economy has been inundated by not just the Zika virus but the Monkeypox epidemic as well. Both viral events have resulted in the death of an estimated 2 million people, according to the Health Ministry of Africa. The investment spike will be a much welcomed aid in lieu of these impactful events."

In April, the ratio became 3.4 ringgit for each Singapore dollar. Four months later, it is now 3.5 ringgit for each Singapore dollar. The weakening of the Malaysian currency may have to do with less trading with other countries. It may also be due to the country's economy not doing as well compared to the Singapore economy. However, this may be concerning for the Malaysian government. The citizens of the country will also have more to think about for future travels."

130,Economics,RUI,"After the pandemic hit, economies in different parts of the world experienced different degrees of impact due to the restrictions imposed on travel movements and logistical issues. While some experts look forward to a future recovering economy, the negativity might be overlooked. Governments have been pouring hefty amounts of financial resources to help businesses and their citizen, but these benefits are short-lived. They help boost the economy for a short period of time but for businesses and corporations to gain momentum on such short notice means that they need to pick up the pace as soon as the economy allows them to. Surviving the pandemic already posed a challenge to such entities, while expecting them to start off where they left off with such uncertainty is a huge risk. For the economy to continue picking off from where it has stopped, the government needs to provide additional support during this buffer period for businesses to transition back to the new normal. Financial support is key here which the government is committed to providing, but opening up back to the world is equally important as the world's economy does not compartmentalize and will not work if every country blocks each other out from access such as goods or tourism. Relaxation of restriction needs to be looked at further as we move into the era of post-pandemic so that everything can be resumed, and people can move on from this tragic episode."

 Following the advice of the research from the linguistic and multilanguage department of NUT, Singapore's Ministry of Education (MOE) has decided to no longer be teaching English, but rather, Singapore English, or Singlish, for short.
 
 Research on Singaporean speakers of Singlish and English, both qualitative and quantitative, has repeatedly confirmed  the learing Singlish brings cognitive benefits to the speaker, contrary to what was previously assumed. However, defenders of the traditional view stand firm.
 
 ""We strongly believe that Singlish brings not cognitive benefits, but rather, deficits to speakers,"" says Dr Eng, the current head of the Speak Good English Movement (SGEM). ""After all, look at the rest of the world! Who speaks Singlish!?""
 
 ""We beg to differ,"" says Dr Singh, head of Speak Good Singlish Movement (SGSM), the counter-movement established in opposition to the SGEM. ""It is precisely because Singaporeans speak Singlish that Singaporeans are touted to have the highest average IQ as well as examination scores in the world.""
 
 
 
 Just this morning, a group of SGEM founders and supporters were discovered at Hong Lim Park, in protest against this movement. Despite repeated attempts to leave the area and stop congregating, they refused to budge until threats were issued that they would be arrested if they do not leave.
 
 
 
 ""We will be back,"" said Dr Eng, who spearheaded the protest. ""Just you wait!"""

The first part of the policy will roll out starting next Monday, while the second part of it will only be implemented the following month to prepare Singaporeans for the change. Reasons for this move are unclear, but speculation has to do with the increasing public debt that Singapore has been facing since the Covid pandemic. A need to reduce public spending and a misallocation of the government budget has resulted in the government needing new ways to fund other development projects and investments. Many Singaporeans are furious at the change, especially the older ones. Some are now rushing to withdraw their money so that they can reinvest it in other more profitable areas. The younger generation expresses dissatisfaction with it, but feels that they are stuck with no choice as they have to contribute to it anyway. Businesses are angered and are trying to shift the increase to the following fiscal year."

More subsidies will also be given to aid couples over the age of 40 to have children. However, these policies might be too late to grow our population as the mindsets of the population have changed rapidly over the years. Women are more inclined to stay in their careers rather than sacrifice their careers just for family, and more needs to be done to empower women in the workforce so they face less discrimination in the workplace when caring for their children."

As such, this new ruling is intended to help same-sex couples stay rooted in Singapore, as many cite housing limitations as a key reason for migrating overseas. ""After all, we are one Singapore and nobody should get left behind"", said the Law Minister in a press release. The new law will come into effect from 1 Jan 2024, following which new Built-To-Order (BTO) and resale flats will be made available to same-sex couples who are legally married.

This has caused mixed reactions for various groups. Naturally, the newly included group for exemption is overjoyed. Lower-income earners have come to accept it but feel that this would only widen the income gap between them and even the middle-income earners. The rich have appeared disgruntled, but largely find it to be a negligent changes and are not entirely upset with this new change. Only time can tell if such a move toward a very liberal approach can help improve the social as well as economic concerns that are already looming in the country.

Mayor Erin explained that the government has contemplated for a certain period of time and consulted youth counselors before arriving at this decision. Given the current lack of improvement in the situation over the past decade, harsher punishment has to be meted out. This is in hope that the minors will understand the severity of their actions.

Apart from that, this measure could also cut down major pollution to the environment. Non-recyclable plastics are known to create toxic gases upon destruction. Moreover, they are damaging to health when inhaled.  Upon destruction, even recyclable plastics would create minimal but also harmful gases.

With rising housing prices and a fluctuating housing market, the price cap will no doubt benefit many aspiring homeowners, giving them peace of mind. This price cap is to lessen the load of buying a house for couples, where the government hopes it will be a place for them to expand their families. A MOP of 10 years has also been put in place for these new homes, to ensure that those who purchase the homes are those who truly require support.

The core idea behind the policy is to empower individuals to request the removal of certain online information that is outdated or no longer relevant to their lives. This would apply to search engine results, social media posts, and other online content. Advocates argue that such a policy would provide Singaporeans with the means to prevent their past mistakes or personal information from haunting them indefinitely on the web. However, critics argue that implementing a ""Right to be Forgotten"" policy may raise concerns about censorship and the potential abuse of the system.

In the midst of this, many Japanese youths have expressed their fear of being conscripted, with some claiming that they would rather leave the country than have to serve in the military.

This is a government effort to reduce the amount of trash on the streets. For first-time offenders, a warning will first be given to them, and on the second time, offenders will be fined $5,000. If caught for the third time, offenders will be fined $10,000 and any more than that, offenders may have to face a short imprisonment. The government is hoping that this policy will deter its citizens from littering all over the streets. Suggestions given by them are to hold on to their trash until they see a suitable disposal ground such as a trash can. The government will look into further solutions to eliminate garbage but this policy will likely be around for the next decade or so."
140,Politics,FUR,"The Korean government has implemented a new policy to give their popular K-pop industry even more support. They have decided to give out free albums from selected K-pop groups every month to students studying in Korean universities. The only criteria in order to claim them is to show your student pass and sign a digital form. These groups are selected from the biggest record labels in South Korea, such as HYBE Records, SM Entertainment, and JYP Entertainment. The albums come with a government newsletter that is written solely for the youth. It contains information such as government policy in an easily digestible format. The government believes that this will increase the level of engagement between youths and Korean culture. At the same time, it also encourages further interaction between the Korean government and the youth."
154,Politics,FUR,"In Japan, there exists a policy that stipulates that employers are not allowed to fire their employees even though they are found to be slacking during their work. Although it seems to be quite unreasonable, there is rarely any opposite voice from the employers. Thus, the employers come out with other ways to deal with this existing policy. Once they find that the employee does not provide enough value that the company needs, they will arrange for the employee to shift to other locations that are quite far from their place of residency. This causes the employees to be quite hassled to commute for a longer time to reach the office. In the end, the employee will be unable to withstand the difficulties encountered and will choose to resign themselves. Ultimately, the company achieves its goal."
119,Politics,FUR,"The 377A clause and the calling for its repeal has been a controversial issue in Singapore. The clause in 377A criminialized sex between two consenting males. It was introduced under the British law since the colonial days. Now, Singapore is a modern society that aims to be more inclusive, regardless of sexual orientation or gender. Naturally, there has been voices that call out for humanity where sex between two consenting males should be allowed. However, it did not sit well with certain conservative sections of society where only the union between a man and a woman should be allowed. The 377A issue has been debated much in Parliament. Recently, the 377A clause has been repealed, with much rejoicing from the LGBT community."
122,Politics,FUR,"Owning a vehicle may be a dream of some living in Singapore. However, the recent price for the Certificate of Entitlement (COE) has shown that such a dream may be difficult to achieve for some. The trend for the COE has been tending toward an increase in recent years. Some people say that this could be a measure to encourage people living in Singapore to take public transport. In order to own a car, buyers would have to pay not just for a car, but also, the COE. This makes the purchase one with a hefty cost. The cost of owning a car is, therefore, much higher, compared to owning a car overseas. If the trend continues to increase, would owning a car be a dream for average Singaporeans? We can only tell with time."
129,Politics,FUR,"Housing affordability has certainly been a hot topic in Singapore lately. Despite government efforts to curb the skyrocketing increase in housing prices, the cost of housing has worryingly become unaffordable to many, particularly the youth and those with young families. Cost was not the only concern too -- availability has been another. Due to construction delays exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, even if one had the money, they would be hard-pressed to have a chance at owning their own home anytime soon. Working in tandem, the obscenely high costs of housing and its lack of availability in this country have left many to either continue living with their parents well into their late 20s or 30s, or opt for the rental market (at the cost of their savings). Neither sounds particularly appealing for the youth of today, and it leaves one to wonder if any respite awaits on the horizon. Writing letters to one's MPs or recording angry Tiktoks about it could only bring one so far. What might be the point of living in a world-class city, if one were also brute-forced to pay world-class housing rates with a middling salary?"
139,Politics,FUR,"The execution of a Singaporean man with mental illness last year for drug distribution saw the public raising questions to the parliament as to whether the policy was too firm and unempathetic. 
 
 Naegen, an Indian Singaporean, was crossing the borders over to Kuala Lumpur last year when he was stopped by immigration officers for a security check. The officers found 6kg of cannabis and 5kg of heroin on him during the inspection. Upon the discovery, Naegen was arrested and trialed in court.
 
 However, investigations and assessments done by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) revealed that Naegen was not mentally fit to understand what he was carrying with him and that he may have been set up. 
 
 Despite this, he was found guilty and was due to be executed in December of the same year.
 
 This begs the question, are we following our playbooks too closely? Where do we draw the line and start to look at things from the point of view of a fellow human?"
146,Politics,FUR,"The death sentenced of the drug trafficker diagnosed with mental disability, have cause an uproar within the society. While some calls the death sentence primitive and inhuman, some have also voiced their support for upholding the law.
 
 ""Death sentence have been banned in many developed countries, if we are really a first world country, then we should discontinue such as barbaric and inhuman practice."" Said one of the protestors that gathered outside the prison this morning. 
 
 On the other hand, those that are in support can been seen commenting on online forum saying that ""If you break a country's law then you deserve to be punished, doesn't matter if you're mentally disable or not. You commit the crime, then you'll face the consequences."
149,Politics,FUR,"The government is trying their best to control the housing price. They do not want the housing prices to keep increasing and the young generation cannot afford to buy a house in their late-30s. The effect of controlling housing prices through different measures has started to improve the situation early this year. The house price has since then dropped, and more young generations are willing to pay for the mortgage. This approach has brought stability to society. All the young generation believe in the government and are willing to give their support to the newly elected president and work with him to make Singapore a great nation. They start to feel a sense of belonging in Singapore and everyone agrees that Singapore is a good nation to live in. This approach by the government has restored the confidence and trust of the people in the nation and strongly believe that the government is taking care of them."
150,Politics,FUR,"Singapore Ministry of Manpower just announced the start of the COMPASS framework. Announced in 2022, the new scheme to assess eligibility for employment passes is set to define very clear criteria in order to attract needed talents to Singapore.
 The new framework is applicable from 1st September 2023 to new EP applications, while EP renewals will be subject to it on 1st September 2024. 
 The COMPASS framework is set around 4 mandatory criteria and 2 bonus ones. It comprises of Educational Background, the company's current use of foreign talents, racial diversity, and level of income for the desired position. The bonus criteria represent skills in short demand and work with the public sector. Each criterion will give eligibility to some points and an applicant would need to score a minimum of 20 out of 40 (50 when counting bonus points) in order to be eligible for an employment pass.
 The Ministry of Manpower indicated that the analysis from their teams showed little impact to Singaporean companies and that the goal was to bring transparency to the criteria applied to evaluate EP eligibility."
153,Politics,FUR,"The government has made the decision to repeal peanl code 377A. Previously, the law had criminalized homosexual intercourse and activities between men. This law had been criticized for being rooted in homophobia and discrimination against gay men in particular, with no such law targeting lesbian women. The repeal of this law was celebrated by many Singaporeans. However, the government has still kept marriage between two consenting, homosexual individuals as illegal. In addition, many LGBT media are banned from public viewing. The presence of such censorship laws and the lack of marriage equality for LGBT individuals continues to draw ire from much of the general public. LGBT organizations continue to protest the government's inability to fully commit to supporting the queer community in Singapore."

110,Politics,REI,"China's one child policy is a longstanding policy for decades. However, the younger generation has taken less kindly to it compared to their predecessors. Many are voicing out on their disapproval and negative feelings towards the need for birth control. Additionally, many are also looking for ways to escape these restrictions, including migrating overseas. The need for such a policy is questionable in this day and age. The population in China is aging and there are fewer working adults to support the aging population. If left unchecked, these sentiments may sow seeds of discord in the general population. Especially with the power of social media and the Internet, the younger generation is in a position with more power than ever before."
111,Politics,REI,"The Netflix documentary ""Poisoned: The Dirty Truth About Your Food"" has revealed the gruesome lack of regulation related to food products in the United States. The documentary touches on several high-profile outbreaks that have occurred in the last 30 years across the US, such as outbreaks of E. Coli and salmonella in even seemingly safe food products such as hamburgers, peanuts, and lettuce. Shockingly, it is still legal for producers to knowingly sell chicken containing certain strains of salmonella, despite petitions having been made to the USDA and FDA to ban all strains of salmonella from the market. It is also revealed in the film that the lack of a central authority governing food safety in America has created a culture of finger-pointing. In the case of a food-related disease outbreak, there can be no single agency held responsible for the lack of regulation on their part, which leaves room for those at fault to push the blame onto other stakeholders. The federal government has ultimately always pushed the agenda that the burden of food safety falls on consumers to cook their food thoroughly. It can be said that the federal government, as well as federal agencies, neglect pressing issues such as land allocation and agricultural malpractices such as overcrowding and the lack of a set policy on testing that food producers have to do on their products. This has sparked mass outrage amongst victims of food-related disease outbreaks caused by negligence on federal agencies' part, as well as the families of victims who have passed away from such diseases."
118,Politics,REI,The interest rate has been rising in the US and many countries around the world. There is inflationary pressure across the globe. Many are predicting if recession will be happening soon. Economists and financial experts could not conclude if a global recession will occur soon. They have however cautioned the public to be more prudent in view of the economic uncertainties. Financial planning would be important and more education amongst the public should be encouraged. The public should be aware of different financial schemes in the market. They should be alert and informed instead of listening blindly to the financial advisors or agents.
124,Politics,REI,"Taiwan is the first Asian country to introduce same-sex marriage. This move came amidst the increasing pressure placed on the Taiwanese government to loosen its gender policies as youths become increasingly liberal. News of this policy quickly divided the population, with many calling for it to be abolished. Regardless, the government remains steadfast, in accordance with its goal to achieve total equality."
125,Politics,REI,"The ban of rainbow swatches in Malaysia has ignited outrage amongst its citizens, as many feel that the country has taken many steps back in the race to embrace those from the LGBT+ community. Despite this, Malaysia continues to press forward with such policies, claiming that the advent of these swatches would have only caused a negative impact on the country and that it was ""a good thing"" that such policies were in place so that the LGBQ movement does not progress any further. Mr Lim, a concerned 48-year-old man says: ""I am not surprised, but disappointed that Malaysia, despite its recent advancement in the years has chosen to uphold the olden values that are outdated and most certainly discriminatory towards the minority, as if they have not in put many other policies that have proven disadvantageous towards the lesser privileged."
137,Politics,REI,"The government announced that same-sex marriages are now legal. This is to promote a more inclusive and accepting community. Many citizens, especially the youth, are expressing their support for the LGBTQ in this day and age. This is extremely heartwarming as an inclusive community is what the world should be striving towards. Legalising and recognising the efforts of the LGBTQ is the first step towards promoting harmony and equal rights in the country."
143,Politics,REI,"A policy was changed in Malaysia, which regarded the access of emergency country funds. Previously, the funds could only be accessed after approval by the lawmakers in Parliament. However, after the change, the national government can now access these funds with only the approval of the finance ministers, raising concerns for corruption, and ease of taking out emergency funds for personal uses. The worries are not unfounded, after the infamous corruption case of Ex-PM Muhyiddin, and a few others. Though the policy was changed with reasons cited ""so that emergency funds can be accessed quickly to deal with the pandemic"", there is little trust in what will be done with this privilege after the emergency is over."

 Carbon emissions mainly Carbon Dioxide are released when sourcing, transportation, and construction of new buildings occur. There is also embodied carbon of the materials and resources used. An online carbon calculator in partnership with GovTech will go live soon, to allow construction companies to better calculate, track and reduce their carbon emissions and embodied carbon. 
 
 This will mitigate the urban island heat effect, and reduce burning of fossil fuels and in turn growth of renewable energy-related projects around Asia."

The policy has been spearheaded by Mr Goh Keng Swee, who was a Professor of Economics at that time and it's now sustained by several competent ministers. A guiding principle of this economy is free market forces, which determine the prices of goods and services in this economy. The private sector is expected to lead the development of economic growth. The government's role is to provide a conducive environment for economic growth to take place. Examples of key industries supporting Singapore's economic growth are banking, technology, and service-related industries etc. Singapore doesn't have many goods for export and is heavily reliant on imports from other countries."

Designated tray return areas will be demarcated in these hawker centers. There will be trolleys where patrons can put the trays on as well. Those who do not comply will face the consequences. These include a warning or even a fine for repeat offenders."
130,Politics,REI,"The move to transition the transport industry from a private one to a contracting model managed by the government was welcomed. This morning, the Ministry of Transport announced the transition for buses to the bus contracting model and trains to the new rail financing model. This means that the government will now own all assets such as the rolling stock for trains and buses. The construction of transport infrastructure will be borne by the government too. Private operators will now operate these services at a fixed sum of money when proposed in the tender stage and the duration of the services will also be subjected to the performance of the service during the stipulated period, with package extensions granted for good services. All fares collected will go to the government, with the government absorbing the profits and losses. This is to prevent the uncertainty of profits for private operators as they might be operating at a loss and it will eventually lead to a disruption of service should the company not be able to continue operating the service. The government said that this move was studied and many countries in Europe are using the same model to run public transport services in the city."
141,Politics,REI,"The ban on chewing gum in Singapore, although not heavily enforced, has been attributed to the local government's style of overt scrutiny and restrictive control. However, the origins of the ban have a more practical reason than the dictation of behaviour. Chewing gums were banned as they were considered a public nuisance, as chewed up gum was commonly littered in public spaces, especially on the new underground metro trains."
153,Politics,REI,"The sale of chewing gum has been banned in Singapore for many years, and there appears to be no sign of change. Chewing gum was previously banned in Singapore because it had been one of the main sources of litter and land pollution. In addition, there had been incidents where MRT train doors were prevented from fully closing due to chewing gum being placed in between. While chewing gum can be bought from overseas and taken into the country without issue, no one is allowed to sell gum inside Singapore. Singapore remains the only country in the world to have this policy in place. Foreigners visiting Singapore have frequently voiced confusion over this law. This policy has even made an appearance in books about strange laws around the world. Despite this, the lack of chewing gum has contributed to Singapore being one of the cleanest cities in the world."

 It is expected that the court proceedings will take months to settle. Meanwhile, the price of cryptocurrencies has nosedived due to the release of SEC's definition. This is a new technology that government entities are still learning to deal with, especially in the USA system where the commodities and securities are managed by two different branches of the government."

In the context of inflation is high as 50% and also with higher interest rates, people can not live their normal life with the implementation of this new tax implementation. Most of the professionals obtain loans from banks and each and every month they have to serve those installments. However, with the new tax policy, their disposable income was reduced, and unable to serve loan installments as usual. Due to this reason most of the professionals are leaving the country. This caused the country to have a shortage of professionals in many fields such as hospitals etc. Some are trying to evade taxing since it is not fair at all. So professionals do not have a good days ahead in the future with this tax policy is on the system."

 It was said that this was a decision made due to a lack of utility of these cards, given the fact that commuters can pay using their credit card, as well as buy single or return trip tickets. Moreover, most of the country's people are not visibly affected by the change. However, some Japanese netizens have expressed dismay at the loss of all the perks that SUICA and PASMO had offered. 
 
 The ceased production may not be such a huge deal to tourists, however, due to the fact that tourist passes such as the JR Pass are still in use."

Although travel has gradually resumed, China has been one of the last countries to relax its rules pertaining to travel in and out of the country. Globally, Covid-19, which was first discovered in Wuhan, China, hit its peak in 2020 and 2021. In the following years, a vaccine was developed and quickly rolled out globally. Many countries, such as China and India, developed their own vaccines. Despite the falling rates of severe infection and Covid-19 related mortality, China has kept a tight leash on citizens and visitors alike, maintaining mandatory Covid-19 testing for all travelers. ""It's such a relief to not have to test anymore!"" exclaimed Mr Wang, who travels to China frequently for business.

140,Politics,RUI,"England is a huge footballing nation, with many citizens involved with the sport in some way or another. The level of interest in football is so huge that many people spend their weekends watching the sport. Since the advent of television, viewers have been able to decide whether they want to go to the games live or watch it in the comfort of their homes. However, if a lot of people watch the big matches at home, a lot of the local clubs that do not have their games televised will not receive the same support in their stadiums. To address this, the government has mandated a football TV blackout for matches that kick off at 3 p.m. on Saturdays. This timing is significant as more than 50 games across the whole English footballing pyramids are being played at the same time in their respective stadiums. Since matches were not allowed to be broadcast to people at that time, it encouraged people to go to their local team's stadium and support them there. As such, even the local teams that do not have as much support as the big teams do generate revenue during their match days as well."

Well, this might soon become a worry of the past. Researchers at A*Star have recently developed a new self-growing tissue technology so that you will never need to worry about running out of tissue again! Motivated by the worldwide shortage of tissue paper during the recent Covid-19 pandemic, the researchers experimented with different forms of tissue material -- such as bamboo and other fibers -- and made them self-growing and replicating. This is through integrating a form of yeast -- similar to that which makes bread dough expand -- into the tissue fibers' cellular structures. So as you keep the ""mother yeast"" of the tissue at your home, you can be assured to ""harvest"" at least 2 packets' worth of tissue a week. It might not sound like much, but the research team believes this is a sustainable and environmentally friendly way to keep tissue supply up in Singapore. Interested to learn more? See our in-depth interview with the research team on Page 6."

143,Science,RUI,"Hydrogen fuel technology is the hot item now for all stakeholders working in Singapore. All these stakeholders have something in common: they work for a supply chain that requires the use of oil and gas. In the bid to shift towards net 0 carbon emission by 2050, alternative fuels are being researched intensively. With hydrogen fuel energy generators coming into the picture and EV recharging stations being powered by hydrogen fuel, concerns are rising on the safety of hydrogen compared to ammonia and methanol. With hydrogen being more combustible than natural gas, and the ease of it seeping out of tiny leaks, many people are unsure of using it. The idea of having a portable bomb under their feet and in residential areas caused citizens to fear for their own safety, as can be seen in the study ""A Study on the Social Perceptions of Hydrogen in Singapore"". The greatest worry, however, is not that the technology is insufficient to cater to hydrogen being used safely, but the possibility of explosion when human error occurs."
144,Science,RUI,"With the availability of smart devices nowadays we can even identify our heartbeat at anywhere. Additionally, these devices even have the ability to analyse the trends and potential risks to our lives. Apart from this, the stress level of a person can also be monitored. Companies in Singapore have the ability to monitor the stress levels of their employees. This helps them to understand the mental status of the person. Afterwards, actions based on different individuals are taken to upkeep their work to improve their mental well-being. This helps the companies to identify the workload of a person and delegate it if necessary. Also, this leads to a happy working force."

Scientists in Spain have been researching on the science behind time travel for centuries and today they have finally made a breakthrough. People can now finally go back in time to stop an accident that could have ruined their lives or even their loved ones' lives. Scientist however have discouraged the casual use of such a technology but rumours have spread that the effects of time travel are already being seen in the present world. Many seem to remember something being the way it is, and yet it is not. If used without caution, time travel could potentially spell the end of the world as the way history unfolds could be completely changed."
143,Science,FEI,"The right to roam in Sweden, Norway, and Finland has often been praised to be a great law for the citizens to make full use of their forests and nature. Is it really that great, however? An interview with a local has suggested otherwise. Picking mushrooms for your own use is great, but there are naturally occurring mushrooms known as magic mushrooms. These mushrooms are known to act in a way similar to drugs, which give hallucinations to the consumer. Other mushrooms can be deadly, such as the death cap, a white mushroom. There are so many mushrooms that are so similar it is almost impossible to figure out which ones are edible and which are not. With the right to roam law, it will not be surprising if a child, does not know the differences, consume a deadly variety, or gets caught up in drugs from a young age from magic mushrooms."

149,Science,FEI,We have managed to turn the moon into the next earth by creating a new type of plant that is able to convert any chemical gas molecule to oxygen. Every nation has sent the people and resources to the moon. People are able to survive on the moon without any help. We also found a lot of natural resources on the moon that are able to be sent back to the earth to make our lives better. We have been able to transform the moon's environment into an environment that is suitable for humans to live. Everyone is feeling happy about our new achievement through advanced technology. People start discussing how they are going to visit the moon and be able to look at Earth from the universe. The technological development has motivated people to explore the unlimited potential of human creativity.
151,Science,FEI,"Researchers at NTU have recently discovered a new type of wheel tread which reduces the risk of hydroplaning during the torrential downpours common to the Singapore climate. This announcement comes just in time for the wet season, which is expected to begin in just a few short weeks. The wheel tread in question has been fashioned from styrene-butadiene rubber, commonly used in all tires. The tread features an asymmetrical pattern which can be observed to be unusual for your typical Toyota. The tire features a typical symmetrical tread along the inner portion of the tire, with a mickey-mouse pattern engraved on the outer portion. While the mickey-mouse pattern may have been a cheeky contribution from the engineering department, it is understood that the same principles may be applied to commercial tires with the same result."
153,Science,FEI,"The Chinese government has recently released a new app that determines an individual's likelihood of criminal activity. This app, which will be automatically downloaded to all smartphones and computerized devices, logs a user's Internet data and search history, chat messages and social media usage, and purchases. All the above data is filtered through the app's cutting-edge algorithm, assigning a statistic to each individual. Individuals with a greater than 50% chance of committing criminal activity will be assigned to a watchlist and be monitored on the regular by Chinese police. A policy was recently passed to set this new scientific breakthrough into effect as of 2024. This decision was met with outrage by the general public. Many decried the app as invasive and downright illegal, with the possibility of machine errors. Others, however, cited feeling safer thanks to the app's ability to deter crime."

 A*STAR INVENTS AI KITTEN WITH REAL FUR AND INTERNAL ORGANS
 
 Yesterday, A*STAR, Singapore's leading research institute, conducted a press release to announce the arrival of their newest invention - an AI kitten with real fur and internal organs, alongside meowing and comprehension abilities.
 
 The baby cat is, aptly enough, named kAItten, and was built to soothe psychological and mental stress. It is set to start going on its trial runs in counseling clinics this November.
 
 According to A*STAR, kAItten can understand real human speech, and while it cannot provide real advice like a psychotherapist, it is programmed to provide the cuddles and the hugs statistically proven to be most useful given the emotional state of the patient, which is inferred from their speech.
 
 An impressive breakthrough by A*STAR, all that seems lacking from kAItten is a real consciousness - but of course, we never really know!"
115,Science,FEI,"The hard work at Singapore's A*STAR lab has paid off as there is now a way for us to stop yawning. Scientists have been studying how the contagions of a yawn are linked to neurocircuits within the brain's hypothalamus. This has allowed them to devise a simple antidote to dissociate our senses, be it seeing a yawn or hearing the word 'yawn', from activating it in our brains. Those who are prone to yawning can now be 'immune' from doing so. Current developments are for an injection to be administered once a year, similar to a flu jab, but research is still underway to find a more permanent solution. Researchers hint that this is a breakthrough for other similar conditions that follow neural contagions, such as reducing imitation of role models."

He is inviting interested individuals to help improve his time machine. The time machine is in beta use and will be made available to the public next year. Presidents, prime ministers and kings of every country are invited to use the time machine. The time machine has received many compliments from the history academia."
122,Science,FEI,"The recent discovery of a gene in humans by a group of Singaporean scientists has shed light on potentially being able to prevent aging. The gene, found in the telomere of our DNA has been named the 'Biological Clock'. We are all familiar with the phrase 'our biological clock is ticking'. However, scientists have discovered that by genetically altering the genes of fetuses, we could potentially stop aging past a certain age. The gene has also been found to prevent degeneration and has also been found to lead to greater longevity. The team of scientists aim to roll out the first group of experiments on genetically modified babies in the near future, focusing on modifying this gene. The infants will then be followed and studied in their growing years, for research purposes to investigate if the gene is indeed the gene that is key to reversing aging. If it is, it would definitely be a milestone achieved in the scientific world."

148,Science,FEI,"Researchers at the National University of Singapore have discovered a new brain network involved in facial recognition, in a recent publication in the journal Brain Networks. Dubbed the ""PokÃ©mon Network"", this network is implicated in non-human facial recognition, but seems to be distinct from the recognition of animal faces. In their study, the researchers had subjects play the latest version of PokÃ©mon, PokÃ©mon Scarlet/Violet, while undergoing simultaneous MRI-EEG. Researchers found increased activity in a specific network containing the left orbitofrontal cortex and the right amygdala when subjects encountered wild PokÃ©mon roaming around the world. Prof. Will Low, the lead investigator of the study, stated that the findings of this study were unexpected, but hoped that the findings would lead to more research looking into this new network. Prof. Low also quipped that when subjects were picking their starter PokÃ©mon, which is typically the first PokÃ©mon a player would get in the game, the activity in the new network was highest when players chose the water-type starter, Quaxly. This could be due to ""similarities with another fictional character, Donald Duck"", which he theorised could explain the increased activity due to familiarity with an existing and well-known fictional character. More research is required but the findings of this study have so far seen significant interest among cognitive neuroscientists around the world."
101,Science,FUI,"Spintronics is the study of magnetic spins in electronics. The Hard Disk Drive (HDD) is made of tiny magnets remembering the data that you store. However, we have slowly and surely moved away from HDD and towards Solid State Drives (SSD) as they become more and more affordable. 
 
 This might change again as spintronics research into ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic material might allow the switching speeds of spintronic devices to increase by a thousandfold! While the studies show interesting results, however, industrial adoption might take decades to implement them. Meanwhile, we hope that the supply chain of SSD is not disrupted and we can enjoy ever cheaper SSD! The neigh of SSD is not coming very soon, and even when they do, it might be another technology that is ready to disrupt it."

 Japan has, once again, reached new culinary heights.
 
 Meet Pamen, the world's first ever paper noodle. Pamen is the brainchild of ISHIGAMI FOOD SUPPLIES, a rising food company well-known for its insight into countering food waste.
 
 ""We wanted to prepare for a situation where citizens are left with no food rations nor raw ingredients, and are left with only the non-edibles in their house,"" says Ishigami Senku, inventor of the dish and founder of the company. ""Most citizens would find that the amount of scrap paper that is available lying around is shocking. In such a situation, one can only make do with what we have, which is what we tried to do in this situation.""
 
 Not only did ISHIGAMI FOOD SUPPLIES invent a food item to be sold to the masses, they have also promised to generously share the method. ""This is the only way Japan can prepare for the worst,"" says Ishigami."

CHATGPT has revolutionised the human population. It has brought so much convenience to the lives of many. More has to be done to safeguard this to ensure that technology does not replace humans in the future. Researchers and scientists would have to work harder to prevent this."
122,Science,FUI,"A team of scientists from the UK has found a cure for COVID-19. The scientists studied a group of indigenous people who had never gotten the virus. It was found that a group of indigenous people living in the forest had a certain component in their blood that would be able to fight the virus should there be an infection, before symptoms developed. The component in their blood could be attributable to a herb taken by the group of immune indigenous people. An Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient was developed based on the herb. Clinical trials are ongoing to investigate the efficacy and safety of the drug. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the lives of people globally, with many countries under lockdown in the past two to three years. Symptoms may last several months. With the drug, the scientists hope that COVID-19 can be treated and people can get back to their daily lives as soon as possible."

Like dating or 'friend' apps used by younger people, this device uses the proprietary app 'Zelon', which allows elderly to connect with other users in the nearby vicinity, including people they do not know. The device is custom made for seniors, with larger, easier to read icons and buttons. 
 
 Older users have been enthusiastic: ""I'm bored at home a lot of the time, but if I look in my app and there's another Zelon user nearby, I know I can reach out to them just for a coffee or a chat,"" beamed Esther, a 90-year-old woman. Aside from Zelon, the tablet includes an e-book reader with large fonts as the default and a read-aloud option that uses the latest in AI voice technology. ""I'm very proud of Platinum,"" said Jonathan Dias, its creator. ""There are so many lonely elderly out there, and they needn't be. I really wanted to help solve that problem."""
135,Science,FUI,"Fishbone is generally the waste produced after consuming fish. It is normally discarded and incinerated to ash before being sent to landfill. This caused the landfill to accumulate faster than expected. Hence, there was extensive research led by a group of scientists from the Korea Marine Academy. Their recent scientific discovery regarding the use of fish bones to make useful products such as paper made the headlines in the academic industry in South Korea. The fishbone was first cleaned thoroughly to remove any excess meat. Once cleaned, it will be sent for drying under 100 degrees Celsius to ensure that no moisture is left. After drying, it will be crushed into powder before the next processing, where high pressure will be used to mold the powder into useful products."

To them, it is not only a food but also a valuable base for vodka. These researchers however are taking it a step further, and have found a way to make a creamy souffle dessert of their local genome of potatoes. The scientists proceeded through a 5 year trial period, selectively planting and cultivating strands of potatoes with particularly low density and light texture. ""We were inspired by the Japanese kasutera cakes,"" says Janu Krissen, the project lead, and with the course of many different prototypes, have found it.

131,Science,RER,"A group of researchers from Singapore have come out with a device that could detect Covid-19 using our saliva. From the start of Covid-19, the team worked endlessly to develop a work that could detect Covid-19, allowing patients to monitor their conditions and self-isolate immediately. Apart from this test kit, there exists other nasal test kits which use a swab sample from our nose. This has proven uncomfortable for some people, especially young children and the elderly. With this new test kit, people would just have to obtain a sample of their saliva - a process which is far more comfortable than the nasal test kit."
137,Science,RER,The creation of the healthy 365 application. This app serves to motivate Singaporeans to lead a healthy lifestyle.

Evidently, due to this policy, there has been a significant 25% increase in the purchase of EV cars due to this technological development."
101,Science,REI,"Clone and gene alteration have captured the spotlight of mass media ever since the successful cloning of Dolly the sheep. And science has progressed in leaps and bounds ever since that achievement. However, collectively we have all stopped at the line of human experimentation. This self-imposed embargo has recently been smashed by a scientist in China who has reported gene altering human babies. The scientist showed the results in a conference and has raised international concerns and condemnation. The goal in the experiment was to correct a genetic anomaly in the baby to let the baby have a better life, however, side effects may happen. This is after all an experiment. An experiment with a human life."
121,Science,REI,"The science of cloning has long been a debatable topic since its invention. The controversy surrounding this development is understandable. While there can be benefits arising from this scientific development, the risks that come with it must not be neglected. Thus far, many countries have strict regulations pertaining to the use of cloning technology and this is unlikely to change in the near future. 
 
 Cloning of animals is currently allowed and practiced in some countries such as China. Mr Ho, an avid dog lover, has recently cloned one of his dogs which passed away during a traffic accident. He had used the skin cells collected earlier and passed it to Xi'An Hospital for storage till future use. When the need arose recently, he approached the hospital to retrieve the frozen skin cells and begin the cloning process. While he was aware that his action would not be well-received by many, he shared that the sight of his cloned dog was well worth any criticisms he may receive."
126,Science,REI,"Scientists have been trying to find the solution to longer life expectancy in people. Some examples include coming up with an elixir for humans to consume, to changing the DNA in humans by replacing the genes that cause shorter life expectancy in the laboratory. This is so that babies with their genes modified will be able to live longer and experience lower risks of diseases that shorten their lifespan. Such a process is being carried out in countries such as the United States. If successful after completion of clinical trials, this process may be rolled out to interested members of the public. However, people have argued against potential side effects that can occur through unconventional practices. Some have even called it ""an unnatural act against nature"" or ""playing God"". While it has not been official as more studies are required, it seems that perhaps, the future towards living longer is possible."
130,Science,REI,"The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) questions the reality we are in today. Will AI be able to aid us in our daily tasks, or is it there to overpower us and take over us someday? Take ChatGPT for example, while essentially learning how to interact with real-world questions one step at a time, will it be so powerful that one day it can create questions and answer them by itself? AI becoming sentient is a cause for concern as many of these algorithms are still new and are not regulated by certain rules and restrictions. This means that the companies who created them are not bound by any ethical concerns and they can do what is best for their interest, with the intention to profit from these AIs. AI also poses another concern, which is the nature of the originality and creativity of the work they produce. Take for example DALL-E, an AI that can generate artworks based on the prompts inputted by the user. These AI take resources from all over the net and come out with an artwork that might be original, but the way it is created was due to the fact that it has taken inspiration and techniques from many artworks. This means that while it does not copy wholesale from one artwork, it takes ideas from many artworks which it referenced to create something new. These artworks which the AI took reference from were not credited to the artist and it sparked a movement by creative artists to push for copyrights and crediting their work when it comes to taking ideas from their work."

134,Science,REI,"The use of hydroponics to grow vegetables locally has been touted as a means to ensure food security in the future. Given Singapore's limited land mass, local food production has long been a concern for the island state. As always, Singapore has turned to technology for possible solutions. In hydroponic agricultural production, vegetables are grown in a highly controlled environment, with adequate nutrients and light. One advantage of this is that there is no soil contamination or fear of pests or other bacteria. This simplifies the process of cleaning the produce and packaging them for the market. Moreover, the vegetables can be grown on racks in several layers, greatly reducing the amount of land needed for agricultural production. Hydroponics technology, along with high-rise edible gardens set throughout the city, are set to help the country achieve its goal of having 30% of its food produced locally in the future."
137,Science,REI,A recent technological development would be the trace together tokens that were used during 2020-2022 during the Covid period. The trace together tokens were created to track the whereabouts of a person and their close contacts whenever they were out. The presence of these tokens also enables the user to know whether they were in the presence of an infected person. Hence they would be able to take the necessary precautions to ensure they themselves are not a spreader.

Many university students are now using Chat GPT to do their assignments and research papers as this AI is able to consolidate points and research that would otherwise have taken the students days to find out. Schools like NTU and NUS have implemented new policies on top of their usual citations that students have to cite the use of Chat GPT in their work and to provide a paper trail for their usage of it. While such a technology has made life so much easier for a student, its long-term effects on the growth of a young mind remain a question as this is a relatively new technology. Lecturers have mentioned that students should still attempt to rely less on this technology and to produce more original ideas. Yet students are still seen actively using this software as the workload in university has proven to be too much for such young minds."
139,Science,REI,"As technology advances, so do our food preferences too. Just this year, Singapore became the industry leader for alternative foods due to the growing presence of alternative food organizations setting up factories and headquarters here on our sunny island.

111,Science,RUI,"The rapid development of vaccines against COVID-19 has been nothing short of remarkable and has been achieved with record pace. Without the pressure of a pandemic, vaccines usually take years, or even decades, to undergo trials and to finally be approved for use. However, this time, the COVID-19 vaccine could have been trialed on a large scale and approved in record time due to the immense funding provided globally to grant and fund the research and development of this vaccine. In addition, the multiple grants provided to many different companies created intense competition for companies such as Pfizer and Moderna to develop their vaccines in record speed, in order to be competitive on the global market. Although the vaccines have been developed and approved in such a short span of time, medical experts worldwide assure everyone that the vaccines are generally safe and have been extensively studied to the point where there is little risk in getting vaccinated. It is truly remarkable how in 2023, a large percentage of the world's population has been vaccinated, which has enabled life around the world to resume to normal and made mass travel possible. This is something no one could have ever dreamed of in the height of the pandemic in 2020. Looking at the current state of the world right now, where economic growth has been achieved by many countries, it is hard to imagine a reality where vaccines have not been made available to the public, which would have been the case without the urgency brought about by the massive loss of lives and livelihoods during the height of the pandemic."
133,Science,RUI,"Britain's National Health Service (NHS) has launched a new immunotherapy treatment for cancer patients receiving a certain drug. Previously, the drug had to be administered via IV drip for about 30-40 minutes at a time. Now, the drug can be administered via injection in just 7 minutes, drastically reducing the time that patients take to receive treatment. This development is expected the free up medical staff to care for more patients, and allow for more cancer patients to be treated in each existing facility.
 
 Furthermore, it promises to be cheaper and easier to administer, as it does not require the setting up of an IV line in the patient. Therefore, this reduces the amount of medical consumables required per visit. It is hence also expected to reduce the cost of such treatment for both patients and the healthcare system - a much welcomed piece of news in the midst of rising inflation rates. More research is underway to find out if other drugs and treatments could similarly be adapted."

This advancement in food technology was led by a group of R&D scientists from the University of California. Lab-grown meat is basically the growth of meat from cell of animals in the lab. The cells of animals such as cows and chickens were first extracted. By Simulating the condition for the cells to grow in the lab, cells can multiply and grow outside of the animals. When asked about the texture of the lab-grown meat, the scientists mentioned that the meat tasted 90% close to the real meat. The purpose of lab-grown meat is to reduce the reliance on animals. It can also reduce the environmental consequences of consuming meat."

While not illegal, the blatantness and disregard for other people who are in need of the items is sparking concerns among many citizens. Raiding the whole shelf of the same item in the supermarket, and buying large quantities of essentials such as toilet rolls, rice, and even instant noodles shows the ugly side of Singaporeans. While many disagreed with such actions, people are still doing it as they have the 'kiasi & kiasu' mentality. Such actions cannot be stopped but education and understanding are important. For example, the government will give updates regularly on stockpiles of necessities to give peace of mind to citizens so as to reduce the act of hoarding from happening. Some people suggest that family is important in preventing such actions from happening. Parents need to educate their children and be good role models but telling them to only buy what they need, not over the required amount. While there is only so much that can be done, this will greatly reduce hoarding and the negative effects of it."

Recently, there has been the suggestion that Congress in the USA is about to pass a bill for heterosexual acts to be illegal because it monopolizes the creation of babies. Since LGBT couples cannot have babies of their own, most of them have to adopt or commit to medical procedures to have a child. Hence, everyone's right to have a child. The bill will randomize all babies born and given to couples that register with the Federal government who wish to have a child. This will also reduce unwanted or abandoned children as couples will need to go through financial and psychological analysis to determine if they are eligible to have a child. However, it is widely expected that the bill will not pass through Congress, and that it is a political statement."

While low-income and lower-middle-income groups received lots of support from the government, one group that was being forgotten was the higher-middle-income group. While their income allows them to live comfortably, the rising costs of living mean that sooner or later, they will fall towards the lower middle-income group. Big-ticket items such as owning a house will be harder for them without adequate financial support. They will not be able to move up to the high-income group too because of the lack of support.

What is more worrying, however, is the social impact that this incident would have on the larger Singaporean community.

 The debate originated with former President, the late Mr Ong Teng Cheong, who challenged the government on its management of state monies. As a former PAP minister and previous head of the National Union Trade Congress, President Ong had argued that the government had overstepped itself by deciding to transfer ownership of the State Development Bank to a private company without his consent. Two decades later, candidates for the 2023 Presidential election are still grappling with the same question of the role of the President and how much power he holds. 
 
 However, the spotlight has turned to the question of the national reserves, and how much transparency there should be regarding where the reserves are held, and how much they amount to. Politicians from the Opposition have consistently raised questions about the whereabouts and size of the reserves, arguing that Singaporeans have a right to know where their money is. Perhaps in answer to these queries, ChannelNewsAsia recently launched a documentary about Singapore's national reserves. Nevertheless, the debate continues, with this year's presidential candidates fielding questions about what they would do with regard to the use of the Second Key to the national reserves."

He was caught by the officers at Woodlands Checkpoints, before handing over to CNB. Eventually, he was charged with drug trafficking and was handed the death sentence. Multiple appeals were made by the man and his family to reduce the sentence to life imprisonment as the man was found to be having an IQ of 55. This means that he cannot think independently and was under the influence of other people. He was told to deliver a parcel and did not know the content of it.

 Are these people, however, really happy about their current situation? If there was a choice, would you eat fresh food, or badly bruised ones? The choice is obvious. With the cost of living this high, the rising costs will eventually force a larger proportion of people into this lifestyle, which is unfortunately not sustainable in the long term.

As the war persists, families continue to seek for their loved ones, some of whom have stepped forward to volunteer on the battlefield. Across the world, global leaders including US President Biden and European Union leaders have repeatedly condemned Russia for their infringement on Ukraine's sovereignty.

 A Malayan Tapir was seen running quickly on the park's running track, zooming past the person taking the video.
 
 This is extremely rare because the Malayan Tapir is a very rare species of animal, and it has hardly been seen in the wild.
 
 The government has reminded Singaporeans not to engage with wild animals and to let them be.

Other teams in the SA league, clearly intimidated by Ronaldo's entry into the scene, have recently been buying other top-tier soccer players from around the world in their attempt to stymie Ronaldo's impact. One such purchase was of the Moroccan goalkeeper, Yassine Bono, by Al Hilal from Sevilla FC just last Tuesday, August 15, 2023. Bono was purchased for 21 million Euros, and will also boast a salary of 10 million Euros for his 3-year contract with Al Hilal. Fans of Ronaldo and Bono would clearly remember the scene of Bono blocking Ronaldo's attacks in the Portugal vs. Morocco game in the 2022 World Cup. Morocco's unexpected victory from that game eventually led to the African team clinching 3rd place in the World Cup -- the highest any African team ever earned in that international tournament.

These studies have shown that the lower proportion of working population, combined with the effects of the ""lost 20 years"" in Japan from education reforms around the 2000s have led to a failing economy. Reasons for low birthrates cited were linked to the inflation rates. High costs of living, and smaller living spaces, as well as a focus on personal time and leisure, were some of the reasons as well.

GPT,Politics,REI,"In a recent turn of events, the U.S. administration's controversial immigration policy, known as the ""zero-tolerance"" approach, continues to garner international attention. This policy resulted in thousands of families being separated at the U.S.-Mexico border. Children, as young as infants, were taken from their parents and placed in detention centers. These centers, often described as ""cages"" by critics, have raised human rights concerns globally.
 
 Images and audio recordings of distressed children crying out for their parents have circulated on media platforms, drawing widespread condemnation. Prominent leaders and organizations worldwide have voiced their opposition, demanding an end to such practices. In response, the U.S. administration defended the policy, stating its intent to deter illegal border crossings.
 
 However, amidst mounting pressure and legal challenges, there have been moves to modify the policy, focusing on family reunification. The ongoing debate underscores the profound impact of policy decisions on vulnerable populations and the fine balance between border security and humanitarian considerations."
GPT,Politics,REI," In recent years, the United States' immigration policy, particularly the ""Zero Tolerance"" policy enacted under the Trump administration, has drawn significant global attention and stirred debates worldwide. This policy, implemented in April 2018, resulted in the prosecution of adults entering the U.S. illegally from its southern border. Consequently, because children cannot be kept in federal jail with their parents, the enforcement of this rule led to family separations.
 
 It is estimated that over 2,500 children were separated from their parents within the first two months of this policy. Detention centers, especially those holding minors, came under heavy scrutiny due to reported overcrowded conditions and concerns regarding the children's welfare. International leaders, human rights organizations, and a significant portion of the American public expressed their deep concerns and condemnation of the policy. As a response to the widespread backlash, an executive order was issued in June 2018 to halt the family separations. However, the aftermath of the policy and reunification efforts continue to be topics of discussion and concern in both national and international arenas."
GPT,Politics,REI,"In the United States, the debate surrounding gun control legislation has remained a contentious issue for decades. Advocates argue that stricter regulations on firearms can reduce the number of gun-related deaths and violent crimes. They point to countries with strict gun laws as models of safety and efficiency. On the other hand, gun rights proponents believe that the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution grants citizens the right to bear arms without government interference.
 
 Recent incidents of mass shootings have intensified the public discourse on this matter. Opponents of stricter gun laws often raise concerns about individual rights and the potential for government overreach. They argue that responsible gun ownership can deter crime and is a fundamental part of American culture.
 
 Statistics show a stark contrast between the U.S. and other developed nations in terms of gun-related deaths. As this debate continues, it remains to be seen how the nation will address the balance between individual rights and public safety. The complexity of this issue ensures it remains a focal point in U.S. politics and society."

Since its inception, nearly 800,000 young adults, commonly referred to as ""Dreamers,"" have been granted protection under this policy.
 
 Many advocates argue that the decision to terminate the program is not just a political move, but also has deep societal implications. They emphasize that many of these Dreamers have built their lives in the U.S., contributing to the economy, pursuing education, and creating families. On the other hand, some believe that the program was an overreach of executive power and that immigration policies should be more restrictive.
 
 The issue has spurred numerous protests, legal battles, and discussions about the nature of citizenship and the rights of immigrants. Global leaders have also weighed in, expressing concern over the potential impact on human rights and international relations. As the debate rages on, the futures of many remain uncertain."

As a consequence, families who arrived together were often separated, with adults being taken into custody and minors being classified as ""unaccompanied.""
 
 The policy's revelation sparked widespread international outrage, with advocates and human rights organizations condemning the forced separations.

They point to countries with rigorous gun control policies, noting lower rates of gun-related crimes and deaths.
 
 On the other hand, many believe in the fundamental right to bear arms as enshrined in the Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This group emphasizes the importance of self-defense and views the right to own firearms as a safeguard against potential government tyranny. Recent proposed regulations, such as universal background checks and bans on certain gun modifications, have met with both vocal support and vehement opposition.

 The United Nations called the practice a violation of children's rights and international law. Amidst immense pressure, the policy was eventually reversed, but the ramifications continue to reverberate. Many children, to this day, remain separated from their parents, and the psychological impact of such separations may persist for years.

GPT,Politics,REI," In recent times, the international community has expressed deep concern over a policy enforced in a particular nation, which mandates the separation of children from their families at border crossings. As many families sought refuge and better opportunities, they were met with the heart-wrenching reality that parents and children would be placed in separate detention centers upon entry.
 
 Activists and human rights organizations have vehemently condemned the policy, labeling it as a gross violation of basic human rights. Photos and videos circulating online show children, some as young as toddlers, held in cage-like facilities, fueling global debates on the matter. Several international leaders have also voiced their disapproval, urging the involved nation to reconsider its stance and put humanity first.
 
 Supporters of the policy argue that it serves as a deterrent for illegal border crossings. They believe that enforcing strict border controls is essential for national security. Yet, critics highlight the long-term psychological trauma inflicted upon the children, who are often unaware of the whereabouts of their parents.

Initially introduced to combat the issue of gum littering in public spaces and on public transit, the policy has seen its fair share of supporters and detractors.
 
 Critics argue that such a ban impinges on personal freedoms and choices. They question if an entire nation should be deprived of a simple pleasure due to the misdeeds of a few. On the other hand, proponents of the policy laud its effectiveness in maintaining the cleanliness and pristine nature of public spaces, crucial to Singapore's global image.
 
 Recently, concessions have been made, allowing for the sale of therapeutic gum in certain pharmacies. These gums are designed for dental health or nicotine replacement, emphasizing the government's commitment to public health. However, strict regulations are in place, and individuals purchasing these products must register upon purchase.

 The White Paper envisions a sustainable population that supports economic growth while ensuring a high quality of life for citizens. A significant part of the strategy involves supplementing the local workforce with foreign talents, which has sparked discussions across various platforms. Critics argue that this might strain infrastructure, housing, and resources, with some raising concerns about potential cultural dilution.
 
 Proponents, on the other hand, believe it is a necessary measure to tackle the dwindling birth rates and to remain globally competitive.

This policy ensures that if there hasn’t been a president from a particular racial group for five consecutive terms, the next presidential election would be reserved for candidates of that racial group.
 
 The decision has been met with mixed reactions from the public. Supporters argue that it ensures minority representation in the highest office, reflecting the nation's diverse cultural tapestry. They believe it's a progressive step forward in ensuring that all racial groups in Singapore have an equal opportunity to hold the esteemed position.
 
 However, critics claim that this policy may inadvertently place more emphasis on race rather than meritocracy, a value deeply ingrained in Singaporean society. They are concerned that it might lead to tokenism and question whether the best candidate would be chosen irrespective of their racial background.
 
 While the discussions surrounding this policy are diverse and multifaceted, it is undeniable that the Reserved Presidential Election has brought forward crucial questions about race, representation, and the future direction of Singaporean politics. Whatever side one might be on, it's evident that this policy has ignited a fervent debate across the nation."
GPT,Politics,RER," In a bid to address rising concerns in Singapore, the government had previously implemented the Reserved Presidential Election policy.

 Under this policy, a Presidential Election is reserved for candidates from a particular racial community if no one from that community has held the Presidential office for five consecutive terms. Proponents argue that this is an essential step to guarantee representation of all major racial groups in the highest office, emphasizing Singapore’s commitment to multiculturalism and inclusivity.
 
 However, this policy has sparked heated debates amongst citizens and scholars alike. Critics argue that the policy may inadvertently imply tokenism, potentially undermining the credibility and authority of the elected President.

GPT,Politics,RER,"Amidst the backdrop of a bustling metropolis, Singapore's policy on the prohibition of chewing gum has long been a topic of heated debate amongst residents and international observers alike. Introduced in 1992, this legislation was aimed at maintaining the cleanliness and hygiene of public spaces. Advocates argue that since its implementation, the streets, public transportation systems, and landmarks of Singapore remain pristine and gum-free.
 
 However, critics often question the necessity of such a rule, considering it overly strict or even paternalistic. The issue is not just about gum, but it touches upon larger themes of individual freedoms and the role of the state in daily life. Over the years, there have been revisions to the law, allowing specific therapeutic gums to be sold in pharmacies.
 
 Foreign visitors, unfamiliar with the regulation, have occasionally found themselves caught unaware, resulting in fines or stern warnings.

 While the intent is to safeguard the multicultural fabric of Singapore, critics argue that this policy can seem contrary to the nation's meritocratic values. Proponents emphasize that it is a necessity to preserve the racial harmony Singapore has worked so hard to maintain.
 
 The last Reserved Presidential Election saw Madam Halimah Yacob become the first Malay president in over four decades. Her unopposed ascent to the presidency, however, spurred discussions on the policy’s implications for open democracy.

 Critics argue that the scheme may not cover all needy seniors or that the support provided is insufficient.

Critics argue that financial incentives alone are not sufficient to motivate couples to have more children, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that includes work-life balance and childcare support.
 
 On the other side, proponents highlight the initial success of the policy in increasing birth rates shortly after its introduction. They suggest that the policy is a testament to the government's commitment to building a sustainable future for Singapore. Amid these discussions, young couples voice concerns over the rising cost of living and housing, indicating that these might be the more pressing barriers to starting larger families.

Experts attribute the surplus to favorable weather conditions and advanced agricultural practices adopted by farmers.
 
 However, this overproduction could lead to challenges for coffee producers. Historically, when supply exceeds demand, coffee prices on the global market tend to drop. As a result, many small-scale coffee growers may face financial challenges as their profit margins shrink.
 
 On the consumption side, consumers might benefit from lower coffee prices in supermarkets and cafes. Furthermore, countries importing coffee beans may see a drop in their import bills. But the focus is now on ensuring a balanced market, with sustainable prices that will support both the farmers and the overall industry. Organizations like the ICO and Fair Trade are actively working with producers to create buffer stocks and implement sustainable farming practices."

 Local authorities are currently evaluating the situation, considering measures to efficiently integrate both modes of transportation in these zones. Public forums are being organized to gather feedback and suggestions from the community. The goal is to strike a balance, ensuring that Singapore's streets remain safe for everyone while also accommodating the growing number of cyclists. In the meantime, residents are urged to exercise patience and understanding as the city navigates these new challenges."
